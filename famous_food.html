       <p>   When in Amritsar, start out with the Golden Temple. The best time to visit is during the morning when the Guru Granth Sahib is brought to the inner sanctum. After offering your prayers, head over to the langar, the largest free kitchen in the world! The volunteers here cook and serve a simple meal of dal, roti, sabzi and kheer to lakhs of devotees each day. Even if you don’t have the time for langar, don’t leave the Kara Prasad on your way out. You will have to jostle among a large crowd for this ghee-laden delicacy but a bite of it will prove to be totally worth it!</p>

       <p>   Sarson Da Saag (as it is known in Punjabi) or (Sarson Ka Saag, in Hindi, Urdu) is a popular vegetarian dish from the Punjab region of South Asia. It is made from mustard greens (sarson) and spices such as garam masala, ginger and garlic. It is often served with makki di roti.
The dish is regarded as the traditional way to prepare saag and is usually served with makki di roti (literally "unleavened cornbread". It can be topped with either Makkhan (unprocessed white butter or processed yellow butter) or more traditionally with ghee (clarified butter). Some spinach (called palak in Hindi) may be added to enhance colour and thicken the dish, though this may alter the flavor. Also added some bathua, sarson greens, onion, tomato and all ground spice.
Mustard is a winter and spring delicacy, and its relative abundance in Punjab has made it one of the most popular dishes in those regions.</p>

<h2> 5. Amritsari kulfi</h2>

       <img src="images/kulfi.jpg" align="center" height=325px width=500px>
       

<p> Kulfi  is a frozen dairy dessert originating from the Indian subcontinent in the 16th century. It is often described as "traditional Indian ice cream. It is popular throughout India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Burma (Myanmar), and the Middle East, and widely available in restaurants serving cuisines from the Indian subcontinent around the world.

Kulfi has similarities to ice cream in appearance and taste; however it is denser and creamier. It comes in various flavours. The more traditional ones are cream (malai), rose, mango, cardamom (elaichi), saffron (kesar or zafran), and pistachio. There are newer variations such as apple, orange, strawberry, peanut, and avocado. Unlike ice cream, kulfi is not whipped, resulting in a solid, dense frozen dessert similar to traditional custard-based ice cream. Thus, it is sometimes considered a distinct category of frozen dairy-based dessert. Due to its density, kulfi takes a longer time to melt than Western ice cream.</p>
<h2> 6. Amritsar de pappad</h2>

<p> Amritsari Papad or papar is a variety of the papad snack  specific to the north Indian state of Punjab and the surrounding region, and even more specific to the city of Amritsar. Amritsari papad is famous throughout India, and is also exported abroad.

Like papad elsewhere in India, Amritsari papad is made from seasoned dough, usually of hulled urad daal flour, seasoned liberally with salt, black pepper, heeng (asafoetida), cumin, coriander, pomegranate seeds, and sometimes garlic. The proportions are highly variable, leading to a large variety in taste and pungency. The dough is rolled into wafer thin discs the size of a small plate, and sun-dried to prepare raw papad. Flours from other sources such as lentils, chickpeas, rice, tapioca or potato, are sometimes used. Dried papad will keep for several months without refrigeration. Although now done by machines, papad was traditionally rolled out by hand, requiring a fair amount of force because of the dryness of the dough -- indeed, In Hindi and Punjabi, "papad belna" (rolling out papad) is still a metaphor for any laborious or arduous task.

Papad is prepared by roasting in an oven or on an open flame, and because it is so thin and dry, takes but a fraction of a minute to be done. In Punjab, it is typically served as an accompaniment to a meal after roasting in an oven or on an open flame, but elsewhere in India it is also eaten as an appetizer or snack, with toppings such as chopped onions, carrots, chutney or other dips and condiments. Papad is a low calorie food but has a high sodium content.</p>
